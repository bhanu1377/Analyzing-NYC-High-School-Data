# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test given to graduating high schoolers in the US every year. The SAT has 3 sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. The SAT is used by colleges to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on the SAT scores of students, along with additional demographic datasets.

New York City has a significant immigrant population, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups consistently performed better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair, for example.
